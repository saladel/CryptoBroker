## Description

A Crypto application that gets cryptocurrency prices using [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com) API and displays it Naira.


## Architecture and Tools Used

- The application is built using Swift and SwiftUI.
- I made use of Async/Await for networking because of its short and straightforward syntax.
- I used [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) for downloading and caching the images. Kingfisher improves UX, by not having to download every image whenever the user closes and opens the app.
- I used the Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM) architecture.
